# MusoMania - "Where Music Meets Opportunity"

MusoMania is a social media web application designed for musicians to connect, collaborate, and monetize their talents. The platform empowers musicians by allowing them to share their music, find bandmates, sell rights or sheet music, and even offer their skills as a service (e.g., recording drum loops). This platform also solves a common problem faced by video editors when looking for integrating music into their creations and finding copyright free music be dull and copyright music be expensive. 

By leveraging a tailored algorithm, MusoMania enhances user experience by recommending music and connections based on general location and individual preferences. The platform fosters a safe and engaging environment with features like chats, a popular page, and a friends list.

## Features

The key features of the MusoMania platform are:

- New user registration;
- Access to a personalized feed of posts;
- The ability to share oneâ€™s own music via audio file upload;
- The ability to search and find bandmates and/or music partners;
- Communicate with other users to pursue the sale of music rights; and
- Offer personalized services to other members of the community
